# EMS | Exam Monitoring System

In higher education, many tasks related to fraud detection have been automated, yet exam monitoring is still conducted by teaching staff and therefore tends to be prone to human error and misestimation. With this project we would like to propose a system based on stereoscopic computer vision that provides a scalable and low-cost approach to automated exam monitoring.
